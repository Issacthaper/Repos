My reponsibilities were to analyze the code and design some test cases to figure out the code errors and bugs. Apart from that I was also responsible for writing code for developing a software on which team is currently working. I was part of some brilliant projets.

                                    <p class="lead" >Stands for "Information Technology," and is pronounced "I.T." It refers to anything related to computing technology, such as networking, hardware, software, the Internet, or the people that work with these technologies. Many companies now have IT departments for managing the <a href="http://ecomputernotes.com/fundamental/introduction-to-computer/what-is-computer">computers</a>, networks, and other technical areas of their businesses.Over the ensuing decades, many corporations created so-called "IT departments" to manage the computer technologies related to their business. Whatever these departments worked on became the de facto definition of Information Technology, one that has evolved over time. Today, IT departments have responsibilities in areas like computer tech support, business computer network and database administration, business software deployment, and information security. Especially during the dot-com boom of the 1990s, Information Technology also became associated with aspects of computing beyond those owned by IT departments. This broader definition of IT includes areas like <a href="techopedia.com/definition/23889/web-development">web development</a>, software development, computer systems architecture, and project management.
